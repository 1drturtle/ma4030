# Math Notes 09/01

## Recap

- Average Rate of Change is the slope of the secant line
- Instantaneous Rate of Change is the slope of a line tangent at a specific point
- Function fails to have slope at sharp turn or cusp
- Function fails to have a slope at a point where slops of secant lines approach different values from left and right of a specific point.
- Can use slopes of secant lines to approximate slope of tangent line
- In a one-sided limit, you only care about the side you are evaluating.

### Look at class notes on OneNote

Condense the parts of the equation into \(\cos x < \frac{\sin x}{x} < 1\)

\(\cos x\) becomes 1 and so the limit become squeezed between the two functions into 0.

## Limits at Infinity

- Describes End Behavior

  - Degree of numerator / degree of denominator gives vague description of end behavior

- if \(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow \infty} f(x) = L\), then \(y = L\) is a horizontal asymptote.

- \(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{3x \cancel{- 1}}{2x \cancel{- 3}} => \lim\limits_{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{3\cancel{x}}{2\cancel{x}} => \lim\limits_{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{3}{2}\)
  - Since we only care about the fraction, we can get rid of extra constants and cancel out the x value.

- Dividing numerator and denominator by x, (the highest power of x found in equation)

- You can separate each term in a limit, and take the limit individually of each term.
