## Applications of Derivatives

### q254

- a) Plug in 1.5 to the function, __answer in radians__
- b) Find the derivative, plug 1.5 into the derivative function.
  - \(f(x) = -3\cos(\pi x * \frac{\pi}{4})\)
    - \(u = \pi x * \frac{\pi}{4}\), \(y = -3\cos(u)\)
  - \(f'(x) = 3\sin(u) * (\pi)\)
  - \(f'(x) = 3\pi \sin(\pi x * \frac{\pi}{4})\)
