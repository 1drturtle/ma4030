## Recap

- Dominant Function: Function that gets bigger faster.

  - If dominant function is in the numerator, it approaches infinity.
  - If dominant function is in the denumerator, it approaches 0

## Derivatives

Whenever a function is continuous, it should have a derivative at all points except a few exceptions. 

- \(f'(1) = \lim\limits_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(1+h) - f(1)}{h}\)

  - \(f(1+h) = (1+h)^2 = h^2 + 2h + 1\)

  - \(f(1) = 1\)

  - \(f'(1) = \lim\limits_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{h^2 + 2h \cancel{+ 1 - 1}}{h}\)

  - \(f'(1) = \lim\limits_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{2h\cancel{^2} + 2\cancel{h}}{\cancel{h}}\)
  - \(h + 2 = 2 + 0 = 2\)
