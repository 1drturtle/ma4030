## Homework Review

### question 185

\[
f(x) = -sin(x)\\
f(x) = -1(sin(x))\\
f'(x) = -cos(x)\\
y + 1 = -1(x - 0)
\]

### question 187

\[
f(x) = 1 + cos(x)\\
f'(x) = 0 + -sin(x)\\
f'(x) = -sin(x)
\]

### question 198

\[
f(x) = x - 2cosx\\
f'(x) = 1 - 2(-sinx)\\
f'(x) = 1 + 2sinx\\
1 + 2sin(x) = 2\\
2sinx = 1\\
sinx = 1/2\\
sin^-1(1/2) = \frac{\pi}{6}\\
x = \pi - \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{5\pi}{6}
\]

Graph must be increasing to have a positive slope.

- Todo: Find where function is positive, subtracted by the possible values

## Important things

- Derivatives of sine and cosine
- Write equations of tangent lines
- Positive tangent line slopes occur when the graph of the function is increasing, and vice-versa.

## Rational Derivates

\[
y = \frac{1}{x} = x^-1\\
f'(x) = -\frac{x}{x^2}
\]

- If a function is not continous at a point, the derivative __cannot exist__ at that point.
- Can also be said as "Not differentiable at \(x = 0\)"

## Intermediate Value Theorem

- If \(f(x)\) is continuous on \((a, b)\), \(f\) is defined everywhere between \(a\) and \(b\).
- If there is a value c that is between a and b, then \(f(c) = k\) where k is a number between f(a) and f(b).

## Derivative of natural e

- \(f(x) = e^x, f'(x) = e^x\)
- They are the same.

## Product Rule

- Given \((f(x)*(gx))\),
 \((f(x)*g(x))' = f'(x)*g(x) + g'(x)*f(x)\).
- Example \(x^3 * x^2\)
  - \(f'(x)*g(x) + g'(x)f(x)\)
  - \((3x^2)(x^2) + (2x)(x^3)\)
  - \(3x^4 + 2x^4\)
  - \(5x^4\)
