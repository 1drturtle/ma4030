# Calc Notes 10/15

- Local/Relative min/max: The minimum and maximum in a function in an area. AKA Local Extrema.
- At a local extrema, the \(f'(x)\) = 0 or \(f'(x)\) does not exist.
- Critical Numbers: Setting the derivative equal to 0, you get locations of extrema.

## The First Derivative Test

- When the derivative is above 0, the function is increasing, and vice versa.
- Check values of derivative before and after critical value.
- Write increasing/decreasing values as intervals. (x, y)

## Second Derivative Test

- When \(f''(x) < 0\), then \(f(x)\) is concave down.
- When \(f''(x) > 0\), then \(f(x)\) is concave up.
- At the location of a change in concavity, \(f''(x) = 0\)
- Hypercritical numbers/Possible points of __inflection__: Points where concavity changes.

## Extreme Value Theorem

- To find extrema of a closed interval, plug in critical numbers and endpoints into function.

## Second Derivative Test for Concavity

- Find derivative to the left and right of point of inflection, if they are opposite signs then there is a concavity change/point of inflection.

## Analytical Methods

- TBD
