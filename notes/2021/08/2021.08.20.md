Investigation
=============

> "What happens if the points don't do the same thing from the left to the right while converging on one point in a tangent line?"

Could be a piecewise, could be a curve.

> "What is local linearity?"

To form a graph from a slope and a point, you can use point-slope form.

Point-slope: y-y<sub>1</sub> = m(x - x<sub>1</sub>)

Slope-intercept: y = mx + b
