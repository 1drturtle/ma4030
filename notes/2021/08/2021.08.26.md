The instantaneous rate of change of f at \(x = a\) is \(\lim\limits_{h\rightarrow0} \frac{f(a-h) - f(a)}{h}\)


Question 7
----------

7. - a) Limit does not exist at \(x = 5, x = 9, x = 11\)
   - b) Limit does not match function at \(x = 1, x = 3, x = 7, x = 13\)

8. The limit has to exist at that point from both directions, and the value of the limit has to match the value of the function (\(f(x)\)) at that point. The function has to exist at the point.
