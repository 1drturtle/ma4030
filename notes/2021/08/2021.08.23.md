Investigation
=============

Absolute Value Function
-----------------------

- Sharp Turn
- No Slope?
- No number between -3 and 3 that works?
- Horizontal/Vertical line is not tangent in this problem
- No tangent line at x = 2, so no slope.
- No instantaneous rate of change at x = -2 

    (because 1. it's a sharp turn, 2. from the right and from the left the secant slopes don't converge to the same value)

- slope at x = -2 is undefined.

Shorter way to say that? not **Locally Linear**
> At x = -2, x is not locally linear.

Locally Linear
--------------

Locally Linear is a point on the graph where the tangent line converges with the equation to form a linear line and slope.

Tangent lines in Calculus can only exist where it is locally linear.

Not locally linear == no slope

4th Graph
---------

![cusp-turn](https://i.imgur.com/C8br1CS.png)

- Is a __Cusp Turn__ because they approach each other but they do not touch.

- Values are moving away from each other, one is getting larger while the other is getting smaller. **No Local Linearity**


# This whole concept is all limits

Definition of limits in textbook.

> "Let f(x) be a function defined at all values in an open interval containing `a`, with the possible exception of `a` itself and let `l` be a real number, if all values of the function approach the real number `l`, as the values of x (excluding a) approach `a`, then we can say that the limit of `f(x)` as `x` approaches `a` is `l`. (As `x` gets closer to `a`, `f(x)` gets closer to `l`"


Numerical Limits
----------------
1. vertical asymptote, slant asymptote, hole in graph 
2. `f(x)` at `1` will be `undefined`, while `g(x)` at `1` will be `0`
