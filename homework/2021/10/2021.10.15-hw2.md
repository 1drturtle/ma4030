## q1

- \(f(x) = x^{2/3}\)
- \(f'(x) = \frac{2}{3}x^{-1/3}\)
- Check Interval
  - \(f(-1) = 1\)
  - \(f(8) = 4\)
- Check \(f'(x) = 0\)
  - \(0 = \frac{2}{3}x^{-1/3}\)
  - \(0 = x^{-1/3}\)
  - \(x = \) undefined, so critical point.
  - \(f(0) = 0\)
- Minimum of y=0 at critical number \(x = 0\), maximum of y=4 at endpoint \(x = 8\).

## q5

- \(f(x) = 2x - 4\sin x\)
- \(f'(x) = 2 - 4\cos(x)\)
  - \(0 = 2 - 4\cos(x)\)
  - \(-2 = -4\cos(x)\)
  - \(\frac{1}{2} = \cos(x)\)
  - \(x = \frac{\pi}{3}\) is critical value
  - When the derivative hit x=0, the function changes from concave up to concave down and starts increasing.
  - While the derivative is below x=0 ([0, \(\frac{\pi}{3}\)]), the function is decreasing.
- \(f''(x) = 4\sin(x)\)
  - While the second derivative is increasing, the function's acceleration is decreasing, and vice versa.
  - When the second derivative crosses the y axis, the function changes from concave up to concave down
  - The second derivative's concavity is opposite of the functions.
