## q5

- Function is continous because the limit exists, and matches the value of the function.
  - \(f(2) = 9\)
  - \(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow 2^-} f(x) = x^2 + 5 = 9 \)
  - \(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow 2^+} f(x) = 7x - 5 = 9\)
  - \(f(2) = 9 = \lim\limits_{x \rightarrow 2} f(x)\)
- It is not differentiable because the derivative of the left (4) does not match the derivative of the right (7).
  - \(f'(2^-) = 4, f'(2^+) = 7\)
