## q1

- Looking at the graph, I would estimate day 10 has the lowest oxygen content.

## q2

- Looking at the graph, I would estimate that day 5 has the quickest decrease of oxygen content.

## q3

- \(C(t) = \frac{1}{1200}(t^3 - 15t^2 + 1200)\)
- \(C'(t) = \frac{1}{1200}(3t^2 - 30t)\)
- \(0 = \frac{1}{1200}3t(t-10)\)
- \(0 = 3t(t - 10)\), \(0 = t - 10\), \(t = 10\)
- Day 10 has the lowest oxygen content using the derivative.

## q4

- \(C''(t) = \frac{1}{1200}(6x - 30)\)
- \(0 = \frac{1}{1200}(6x - 30), 0 = 6x - 30, 6x = 30, x = 5\)
- The graph was decreasing the quickest on the 5th day.
