## q2

- \(\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}\)
- \(\frac{f(\frac{3\pi}{2}) - f(\frac{\pi}{2})}{\frac{3\pi}{2} - \frac{\pi}{2}}\)
- \(\frac{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}- \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}{\pi} = 0\)
- \(f(x) =\sin(\frac{x}{2})\)
- \(f'(x) = \frac{1}{2}\cos(\frac{x}{2})\)  
- \(f'(\pi) = \frac{1}{2}\cos(\frac{\pi}{2}) = 0\)
- Answer is D, \(\pi\)

## q3

- D, we don't know how the function changes between [0, 1], so we don't know if the function ever reaches \(\frac{1}{2}\).
