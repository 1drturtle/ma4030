## Analyzing Functions with Limits

### Question 10

\(\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow0} sin(\frac{1}{x}) = 0\)

This limit approaches 0 from both sides. (See Figure one below)

### Question 11

\(f(x) = \frac{x^2-4}{x-2}\)

\(f(x) = \frac{(x+2)(x-2)}{x-2}\)

\(f(2) = undefined\)

\(f(x)\) is not continuous because \(f(a)\) does not exist (which creates a hole at x = 2)

### Question 12

Walk through 3 steps of continuity.

1. For \(x = 3\), \(-x^2 + 4 = -5\), so \(f(3) = -5\), which does exist.

2. \(\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow3} f(x)\) does not exist.
    Since the limit does not exist at \(x = 3\), the function is not continuous.
    - \(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow 3^+} f(x) = 4\)
    - \(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow 3^-} f(x) = -5\)
    - Limits do not match each other.
    - \(\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow3} f(x)\) does not exist, therefore \(f(x)\) is not continuous at \(x = 3\).

3. Step 3 not needed since step 2 failed.

### Question 13

1. \(f(0) = 1\), it is defined so step 1 passes.

2. \(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow 0} f(x) = 1\)
    - \(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow 0^+} f(x) = 1\)
    - \(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow 0^-} f(x) = 1\)
    - Limits approach the same number, so the limit is defined.

3. \(f(0) = 1 = \lim\limits_{x \rightarrow 0} f(x)\)
    - Since the value of the limit at \(x = 0\) matches the value of \(f(0)\), the function matches the criteria

Because the function matches all three criteria, the function is continuous at \(x = 0\)
