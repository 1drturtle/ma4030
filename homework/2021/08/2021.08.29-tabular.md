# Tabular Rates of Change

At \(x = 5\), his acceleration is 2.15 meters/second. This was found plotting the data in desmos and finding the line of best fit, and then plugging \(x = 5\) into the equation I got, which was \(y = 0.03x + 2\)

# Correct Way

Use secant line to determine velocity

\(\frac{v(10) - v(0)}{10 - 0} = \frac{2.3 - 2}{10} = \frac{3}{10}\)
