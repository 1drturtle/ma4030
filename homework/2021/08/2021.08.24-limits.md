Question 1
----------
- vertical asymptote, slant asymptote, hole in graph 


Question 2
----------

- a) `f(x)` will have an asymptote at `x = 1` while `g(x)` will have a hole at `x = 1`

|c|f(c)|
|-|----|
|1.1|10|
|1.01|100|
|1.001|1000|
|1|`undefined`|
|0.999|-1000|
|0.99|-100|
|0.9|-10|

|c|g(c)|
|-|----|
|1.1|2.1|
|1.01|2.01|
|1.001|2.001|
|1|`undefined`|
|0.999|1.999|
|0.99|1.99|
|0.9|1.9|

b) f(x) approaches `x = 1` but never reaches it, while `g(x)` simply skips over it, as the numbers around `x=1` are defined but `x=1` is undefined, without seeming affecting the values around it.
