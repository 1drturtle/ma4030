## Graph A
Graph #1 shows a car moving at a constant speed away from the start. Unrealistic because there is no starting acceleration
## Graph B
Graph #2 shows a car moving very quickly but then slows down, but doesn't stop. This shows a car punching it but then chilling out. Could be realistic.
## Graph C
Graph #1 shows a car moving at a constant speed/rate towards the start line, after starting from far away. Unrealistic because car would need to accelerate to get to the speed.

## Comparison
Graph A & C are similar because they are unrealistic with no acceleration/deceleration.
Graph A & B are both moving away from the start
