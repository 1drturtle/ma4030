Question 9
==========

a) \(f(x) = \frac{sin(x)}{x}\)

On the graph, as f(x) approached x = 0, it gets closer to 1.

__\(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow 0} f(x) = 1\)__ (Important to remember)

b) \(g(x) = \frac{cos(x) - 1}{x}\)

On the graph, as g(x) approaches \(x = 0\), the y value approaches 0.

__\(\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow 0} g(x) = 0\)__

> Note: Put table of values when graphing. These two limits are important.

==================

Question 97
-----------

\(\lim\limits_{t\rightarrow9}\frac{t-9}{\sqrt{t}-3}\)

\(\frac{t-9}{\sqrt{t}-3} * \frac{\sqrt{t}+3}{\sqrt{t}+3}\)

\(\frac{\sqrt{t}+3}{1}\)

\(\sqrt{(9)} + 3 = 6\)

> Note: Re-write limit as simplified form and put that before the final step.

__\(\lim\limits_{t\rightarrow9}\frac{t-9}{\sqrt{t}-3} = 6\)__

Question 101
------------

\(\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow\frac{1}{2}} \frac{2x^2+3x-2}{2x-1}\)

Simplifies to \(\frac{(x+2)(2x-1)}{2x-1}\)

Reduces to \(x + 2\), Plug in the limit to get \(2.5\)

\(\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow\frac{1}{2}} \frac{2x^2+3x-2}{2x-1} = 2.5\)
