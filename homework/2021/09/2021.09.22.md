## Interpreting the Derivative

### Question 2

2. Q2
    - a. \(D(140) = 120\) means, that if the patient is 140 lb, they should be given 120 mg of medication. \(D'(140) = 3\) means that, when the patient's weight is 140lb, the rate of mg/lb is increasing by 3.
    - b. We can create the tangent line \(y - 120 = 3(x - 140)\) from the given information. Plugging in `141` for `x`, we get \(y = 3(141 - 140) + 120 = 3(1) + 120 = 123\), or 123 mg for 141 lb.
